Modified bicycles and trained volunteers assist kids throughout their journey of learning to cycle.</td>
          <td>Past research has estimated that 80% of people with Autism and about 90% of people with Down syndrome never get to have the experience of riding a bicycle.</td>

          <td>Many kids with disabilites, as they grow older, might rely on an alternative means of transportation due to the safety risks of driving a car. Because of this, learning to ride a bicycle at a young age is critical for them to be able to travel independently.</td>
          <td>Cycling also provides children with physical benefits. The intensity and energy that cycling workouts require create a satisfactory cardiovascular workout to improve physical health.</td>
          <td>Lastly, cycling can improve the mental health of children. While cycling is often considered a social activity, its potential to decrease levels of stress and anxiety can improve the overall mood of cyclers. </td>
